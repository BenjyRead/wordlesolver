# Wordle solver
Personal project for me to learn rust

Stats (across every single valid wordle answer, of which there are 2315):

Average amount of guesses per success: 3.7036717062634987

Amount of fails: 21

# Use

`git clone` and `cargo run` (defaults to main.rs) and will simulate every single possible wordle game, and at the end calculate average number of guesses per success/ number of fails
